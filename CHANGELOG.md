# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Monitoring Dashboard plugin**: New `dashboard` plugin providing a full-screen, auto-refreshing cluster overview designed for a dedicated display. Shows cluster nodes with CPU/MEM bars, a resource summary, all running and stopped guests with live metrics, recent tasks, and optionally Nomad jobs when `plugins.dashboard.nomad_addr` is configured. Open it from the global menu (ESC → Monitoring Dashboard). Press `r` to refresh immediately, ESC or `q` to close.
- **Nomad integration**: The dashboard plugin integrates with HashiCorp Nomad via its HTTP API (`/v1/jobs?namespace=*`). Configure with `plugins.dashboard.nomad_addr` (e.g. `http://nomad.example.com:4646`) and optional `plugins.dashboard.nomad_token` for ACL-protected clusters. When Nomad is not configured, the right panel shows a per-node guest distribution map instead.
- **Global menu: dynamic plugin entries**: The global menu now automatically discovers and lists all plugins implementing `GlobalActionPlugin`, making plugin entries appear without hardcoded special-cases. The Ansible Toolkit and Monitoring Dashboard both appear this way.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- **LXC/VM create: moved to node context menu**: "Create VM" and "Create LXC" are no longer in the global menu. They are now only accessible from the node context menu, where the target node is already in scope.
- **LXC Edit Configuration: Swap field**: New "Swap (MB)" input in the Edit Configuration modal for LXC containers, positioned below Memory. Setting swap to `0` is now correctly sent to the API (disabling swap), which the previous save path silently skipped.
- **LXC create: Nesting toggle**: New "Nesting" checkbox in the LXC creation form (enabled by default) that sets `features=nesting=1` on the container, allowing Docker and nested containers.
- **Storage: Template Catalog download**: New "Template Catalog" option in the storage Download Content menu (available when the storage supports `vztmpl`). Fetches the Proxmox appliance template list (`pveam available`) and lets you pick a template by section (All / system / mail / turnkeylinux) and download it directly to the selected storage — equivalent to `pveam download <storage> <template>`.
- **Ansible plugin: `env` setting**: New `plugins.ansible.env` config map for passing arbitrary environment variables (e.g. `ANSIBLE_CONFIG`, `ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH`, `ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING`) to all ansible and ansible-playbook invocations. Configurable via General Settings in the toolkit or directly in config YAML.

### Fixed

- **LXC Edit Configuration: false-positive `*` marker on network modal**: Opening and closing the "Edit Network Interfaces" sub-form without making any changes no longer marks the parent form title with `*`. The comparison baseline is now normalized through the same parse→rebuild round-trip used when saving, eliminating spurious change detection caused by key-order differences in the raw API strings.
- **LXC create: privileged container creation**: The `unprivileged` field was being sent as a JSON boolean (`false`), which Proxmox does not reliably accept. It is now sent as an integer (`0`/`1`) consistent with how Proxmox represents boolean-like fields internally. This fixes creation of privileged containers.
- **LXC/VM create: rootfs storage dropdown shows storages from other cluster nodes**: `GetNodeStorages` now filters out storages not active on the queried node. Proxmox returns all cluster-configured storages from `/nodes/{node}/storage` but marks inaccessible ones with `active=0`; previously non-shared local storages from other nodes were shown in the rootfs dropdown.
- **Edit Configuration: network changes now prompt to Save**: After applying changes in the "Edit Network Interfaces" sub-form, the header shows "Network settings updated — press Save to apply" and the parent form title gains a `*` marker as a persistent reminder that the changes are staged in memory and require pressing Save to persist to Proxmox.
- **`go install` version info**: Build date and commit hash now show correctly in the About modal when installed via `go install`. Release constants are embedded in `internal/version/release.go` and updated automatically by the release script, serving as a fallback when ldflags and VCS metadata are unavailable.
- **Release script: `make release` prompt ordering**: The confirmation block now renders before the `y/N` prompt when running under `make`. Previously stdout buffering caused the prompt to appear ahead of the confirmation text.
- **Release script: master sync before merge**: `make release` now fast-forwards local master to `origin/master` before merging develop, preventing push rejection when CI has auto-committed to master (e.g. Nix vendorHash update) since the previous release.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- **Ansible Ad-Hoc Tasks**: Expanded the `ansible` plugin beyond the ping preset so the toolkit can run structured ad-hoc Ansible module invocations against generated inventory, using module/module-args plus the existing scope, limit, target, and timeout controls.
- **CLI: `nodes shell` and `guests shell`**: New interactive shell subcommands that open a terminal session directly from the CLI, matching the TUI's `S` shortcut behaviour.
  - `pvetui nodes shell <node>` — SSHes to a Proxmox node.
  - `pvetui guests shell <vmid>` — enters an LXC container via `pct enter` (or `pct exec` for NixOS containers) over SSH to the host node, or connects directly to a QEMU VM via SSH using the VM's IP address. Respects `vm_ssh_user` / `vm_ssh_keyfile` for QEMU VMs.
  - Authentication follows the standard priority: SSH agent → configured keyfile → `~/.ssh` defaults.
  - Unlike the TUI, no "Press Enter to return to TUI" prompt is shown on exit.
- **CLI: Tab completion for nodes and guests**: All CLI subcommands that accept a `<node>` or `<vmid>` argument now provide dynamic tab completion by querying the Proxmox API. VM completions include the guest name and type as a description (visible in zsh and fish). Requires shell completions to be active (`pvetui completion <shell>`).

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- **Shell Completions**: `pvetui completion` now generates shell completion scripts for bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell via Cobra's built-in completion support. Run `pvetui completion <shell> --help` for installation instructions.
- **SSH Key Configuration**: Added `ssh_keyfile` and `vm_ssh_keyfile` per-profile config fields (and corresponding `--ssh-keyfile` / `--vm-ssh-keyfile` CLI flags and `PVETUI_SSH_KEYFILE` / `PVETUI_VM_SSH_KEYFILE` env vars) for specifying SSH private key paths explicitly. When no keyfile is configured, pvetui now also consults the running SSH agent (`SSH_AUTH_SOCK`) before falling back to standard key paths (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`, `id_rsa`, `id_ecdsa`).

### Fixed

- **gRPC Security Update**: Upgraded indirect dependency `google.golang.org/grpc` from `v1.79.1` to `v1.79.3` to address CVE-2026-33186, an authorization bypass in HTTP/2 `:path` pseudo-header validation.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added

- **Command Runner: Custom Commands**: The Command Runner plugin now exposes a "Custom Command..." entry at the top of the command menu for all target types (host, LXC container, QEMU VM). Users can type any non-interactive command and execute it directly without it needing to be on the whitelist. After a successful run, pressing `w` on the result screen promotes the command into the session whitelist and inserts it at the top of the command list immediately — no close/reopen required. Commands run without a PTY; `sudo` requiring a password will fail fast with a clear error, as will interactive programs.

- **CLI Subcommands**: `pvetui` can now be used as a non-interactive CLI tool in addition to launching the TUI. Running any subcommand bypasses the TUI entirely, making `pvetui` composable in scripts and AI agent workflows.
  - `pvetui nodes list` — list all cluster nodes with status and resource metrics.
  - `pvetui nodes show <node>` — detailed view of a single node.
  - `pvetui guests list` — list all VMs and LXC containers with optional `--node`, `--status`, and `--type` filters.
  - `pvetui guests show <vmid>` — detailed view of a single guest.
  - `pvetui guests start|stop|shutdown|restart <vmid>` — lifecycle operations returning a UPID.
  - `pvetui guests exec <vmid> <command>` — execute a shell command inside a running guest. QEMU VMs use the guest agent (no SSH to the guest required), with automatic PowerShell wrapping on Windows. LXC containers use `pct exec` over SSH to the Proxmox node (`ssh_user` must be configured). Supports `--timeout`.
  - `pvetui tasks list` — list recent cluster tasks with `--recent N` (default 20).
  - `--output` / `-o` persistent flag selects `json` (default, structured stdout) or `table` (human-readable).
  - All subcommands respect `--profile` and work transparently with aggregate group profiles (fan-out queries across all member nodes).
  - No TUI startup banners are emitted when a subcommand is active.
  - Errors are written as JSON to stderr; the process exits non-zero on failure.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed

- **Community Scripts Metadata Source**: Switched the Community Scripts plugin from the stale archive fallback to the newly exposed public PocketBase metadata API at `db.community-scripts.org`, restoring up-to-date script listings while keeping install script execution on `community-scripts/ProxmoxVE`.
- **Community Scripts Development Script Labeling**: Community Scripts entries now indicate when a script is in development and sourced from the `community-scripts/ProxmoxVED` dev repository.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- **Storage Browser Navigation**: Added a first-class Storage page with its own configurable shortcut (`Alt+4` by default), footer/help integration, node-scoped storage browsing, content filtering, and storage refresh controls.
- **Storage Content Acquisition**: Added storage-level download actions for URL-based ISO/template/import downloads and OCI image pulls from the Storage page.
- **Guest Creation Flows**: Added initial node/global creation flows for VMs and LXCs, including VM creation from ISO-based installers and LXC creation from templates.

### Fixed

- **Storage Browser Actions**: Added storage-content context actions for deleting ISO/template/snippet/backup entries and restoring backups directly from the Storage page, while removing the redundant Storage Browser entry from the Global menu.
- **Community Scripts Metadata Source**: Temporarily restored Community Scripts plugin metadata loading by switching from the removed upstream frontend JSON path to the archived `community-scripts/ProxmoxVE-Frontend-Archive` metadata source while upstream stabilizes a replacement for the new website architecture.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- **Ansible Toolkit Plugin**: Added a new opt-in `ansible` plugin with integrated toolkit workflows for generating inventory from loaded Proxmox nodes/guests (YAML or INI, compact/expanded styles, optional custom `inventory_vars`), previewing/saving inventory, running `ansible -m ping`, executing `ansible-playbook` with reusable form state, and providing an SSH setup guide. Includes plugin settings for default user/password/key path, limit behavior, and default Ansible extra arguments.

### Fixed

- **Startup Profile Chooser Default Handling**: When `default_profile` is unset, startup now correctly prompts for profile/group selection even if a profile is literally named `default`, and non-interactive launches now return a clear error instead of exiting successfully without starting the app.
- **Template Guest Handling**: Template VMs/CTs are now labeled as templates in the guest list and Guest Details, no longer appear as ordinary stopped guests for lifecycle UX, and are excluded from start-oriented context-menu and batch-action flows.

## [1.0.20] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **Guest Network Config Editor**: Added an “Edit Network Interfaces” action in guest configuration with a dedicated interface editor (bridge/VLAN/rate/firewall plus VM/CT-specific fields), including LXC DHCP/Static IP assignment toggle and LXC nameserver/searchdomain fields, writing back to Proxmox `netX` config entries on save.
- **Cluster Group Mode (HA Failover)**: Added per-group `group_settings` with `mode: cluster` so a group can connect through one active profile and automatically fail over to the next healthy candidate.
- **Group Mode Controls in Profiles UI**: Added a mode selector to the Edit Group dialog and a cluster mode marker in the Connection Profiles list.

### Fixed

- **Guest Details Description Consistency**: The Description row now always appears in Guest Details and shows `N/A` when a guest description is empty; for stopped guests, details now hydrate description from config when available.
- **Running Guest CPU Metric Stability**: Running guests now display `0.0%` CPU instead of transient `N/A` when APIs briefly return invalid non-finite CPU values after restart.

- **Guest Selection Snap-Back After Config Save Refresh**: Preserved any user-initiated list selection changes made during in-flight refreshes so completion no longer forces selection back to the pre-refresh guest/node.

- **Transient CPU N/A After Guest Restart**: Sanitized non-finite numeric values from API responses during single-guest refreshes so running guests no longer briefly show CPU as `N/A` when metrics momentarily return `NaN/Inf` after restart.

- **Tasks Panel Focus Freeze**: Fixed an immediate freeze when tabbing from Task History to Active Operations by keeping task table cells selectable and avoiding a tview table selection loop.
- **Cluster Failover Refresh Re-entrancy**: Triggered failover refresh asynchronously to avoid nested `QueueUpdateDraw` callback paths.
- **Single Guest Refresh IP Staleness**: Fixed per-guest refresh so running guests (including LXC containers after network/VLAN changes) update IP information without requiring a full cluster refresh.

## [1.0.19] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Vim-Style List Navigation**: Added `gg` (top) and `G` (bottom) navigation in focused Nodes, Guests, and Tasks lists/tables.
- **Guest Multi-Select + Batch Actions**: Added `Space`-based guest multi-selection and batch context-menu actions so you can queue operations across multiple selected guests.
- **Task Queue Throughput Control**: Added a global in-progress concurrency limit so queued operations are processed without overloading the API/task polling path.
- **Queued Task Cancellation**: Added support for canceling queued tasks before they enter the running state.
- **Advanced Guest Filter Modal**: Added a Guests-page advanced filter modal (default `Ctrl+f`, configurable via `key_bindings.advanced_guest_filter`) with structured criteria for status, type, node, and tag matching, while preserving combined text-search + advanced filtering across refreshes.

### Fixed

- **Release Workflow Social Announcements**: Prevented Mastodon announcement failures from breaking GoReleaser runs by handling social posting in the non-blocking release announcement script step.
- **Community Script Install on Fish Shells**: Forced remote script installer commands to execute under `/bin/bash -lc` so node accounts using `fish` as default shell can install community scripts without shell syntax errors.
- **Task Panel Focus Stability**: Prevented a Tasks-page freeze when tabbing between Task History and Active Operations by avoiding layout rebuilds during active task refreshes and tightening pane focus switching logic.
- **Latest golangci-lint Compatibility**: Updated affected code paths to satisfy current gosec/staticcheck rules (log taint handling, URL validation hardening for community script metadata fetches, and `fmt.Fprintf` formatting fixes), keeping local and CI lint runs aligned.
- **Global Menu Defaults**: `Esc` is now the primary global menu key by default, while `global_menu` remains configurable as an optional additional shortcut.
- **Global Menu Unbind Support**: `key_bindings.global_menu: ""` now correctly disables the additional global-menu shortcut instead of silently reverting to the default.
- **Task Keybind Configurability**: `toggle_task_panel` and `task_stop_cancel` can now be customized like other key bindings.
- **Help Modal Keybinding Layout**: Reorganized help sections so task controls and page-specific actions are grouped more clearly.
- **Back Navigation Consistency**: Standardized back/close handling so Backspace works alongside Escape in Command Runner, Snapshot Manager, and Backup Manager flows.
- **Context Menu Placement**: Node/Guest context menus are now anchored near the focused list selection instead of always centered, keeping details panes visible while menus are open.

## [1.0.18] - 2026-02-14

### Added

- **Async Task Queue System**: Introduced a queued background task system for VM operations with task panel visibility controls, UPID tracking, improved keyboard/focus behavior, and safer non-blocking UI execution flow.
- **Profile/Group CLI Listing**: Added `--list-profiles` to print configured connection profiles and aggregate groups (including key connection details and memberships) and exit, making it easier to pair with `--profile` for direct startup selection.
- **QEMU Guest Agent Toggle in VM Config Editor**: Added a checkbox to VM Edit Configuration so the QEMU guest agent can be enabled/disabled directly from the TUI.

### Changed

- **Nix Flake Source Handling**: `flake.nix` now uses `src = self` for `buildGoModule` to reduce repeated source copying and improve local `nix build`/`nix run` performance.

### Fixed

- **Guest Insights Plugin ID Compatibility**: Renamed the plugin identifier to `guest-insights` while keeping `demo-guest-list` as a backward-compatible alias so existing configs continue to load without changes.
- **Form Label Readability**: Standardized form field labels to use `HeaderText` color across VM/task/wizard dialogs for improved readability in terminal themes where default secondary text appears too dim.

## [1.0.17] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- **Node Disk SMART Information**: Node details now display disk health status and SMART data for all attached disks, including disk type (SSD/HDD), size, model, and health status (PASSED/FAILED).
- **System Update Notifications**: Node details now show available system package updates with version information, displaying up to 5 pending updates with a count of any additional updates.
- **Icon Toggle**: Added multiple ways to control icons/emojis throughout the UI. Icons are enabled by default. To disable: use `--show-icons=false` CLI flag, `PVETUI_SHOW_ICONS=false` environment variable, or `show_icons: false` in YAML config. (#75)
- **Guest Tags**: Added editable tag list for VM/LXC configuration, using a semicolon-separated tag field in the Edit Configuration form. (#76)
- **SSH Jump Host Support**: Added SSH jump host (bastion host) configuration for accessing Proxmox environments through an intermediate SSH server. Configure via config wizard, CLI flags (`--ssh-jumphost-addr`, `--ssh-jumphost-user`, `--ssh-jumphost-keyfile`, `--ssh-jumphost-port`), environment variables (`PVETUI_SSH_JUMPHOST_ADDR`, `PVETUI_SSH_JUMPHOST_USER`, `PVETUI_SSH_JUMPHOST_KEYFILE`, `PVETUI_SSH_JUMPHOST_PORT`), or YAML config (`ssh_jump_host` section). Per-profile configuration supported.
- **Release Announcements**: GoReleaser now posts release announcements to Mastodon and Bluesky when the required secrets are configured.

### Changed

- **Release Pipeline**: Simplified GitHub token configuration by removing duplicate secret names (`HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN`, `SCOOP_BUCKET_TOKEN`) in favor of consistent `_GITHUB_TOKEN` naming.
- **Makefile Build**: `make build` now uses the build cache by default; set `REBUILD=1` to force a full toolchain rebuild.
- **Local Dev Workflow**: Added `build-fast` and `test-quick` targets and cached package lists for faster local builds/tests; optional `TRIMPATH=0` disables trimpath in local builds.
- **Nix Flake**: Automated vendorHash updates with dependency changes to prevent hash mismatches on Nix installations. (#80, #81)

### Fixed

- **UI Deadlocks**: Eliminated nested QueueUpdateDraw deadlocks that occurred when displaying error messages from menu handlers by switching to direct SetFocus calls. This fixes deadlocks in various scenarios including interacting with offline nodes and group connection handling.
- **Group Connection Handling**: Improved connection handling during bootstrap and resource fetching in aggregate groups to prevent UI freezes.
- **Group Mode Filter Persistence**: Fixed active search filters being lost during manual refresh (Ctrl+R) and after VM operations in aggregate group mode. Filters now persist correctly across all refresh operations.
- **Group Mode VM Details Refresh**: Fixed VM details panel not updating after operations (reboot, start, stop, etc.) in group mode by ensuring the correct profile-specific client is used to fetch fresh VM data.
- **Group Mode Source Profile Preservation**: Fixed VMs losing their cluster association after operations in group mode, which caused "source profile not set" errors. The SourceProfile field is now preserved when refreshing individual VM data.
- **Group Mode Initial Loading Feedback**: Added header loading message "Loading guest agent data" during initial startup in group mode. Previously, profile names would appear in the UI without warning after a silent enrichment process.
- **CI Cache Noise**: Removed redundant Go module cache restore in CI to prevent tar "File exists" errors during lint/test/build jobs.
- **Group Mode Config Polling**: Avoided cross-profile cluster resource polling when only tags change, reducing delays after saving guest configuration.
- **Header Loading Animation**: Prevented overlapping loading spinners that made the header animation appear overly fast during concurrent updates.

## [1.0.16] - 2026-01-01

### Added

- **Age Key Directory Override**: Allow specifying where `.age-identity` and `.age-recipient` are stored via `age_dir`, `--age-dir`, or `PVETUI_AGE_DIR` for shared config setups. (#72)
- **Tilde Expansion for Paths**: `~` now expands in `age_dir` and `cache_dir` values from config, flags, and environment variables.

### Fixed

- **Config Wizard Auth Validation**: Read live form values at save time and validate the profile being edited to avoid stale auth errors across platforms. (#69, #70)
- **Config Wizard Token Validation**: Warn when only one of token ID/secret is provided so partial token input isn't silently discarded.
- **Config Wizard Defaults**: When launched via `--config-wizard` without an existing config, the wizard now seeds from the default template to match onboarding behavior. (#69, #70)
- **Windows Config Path Handling**: Default to the standard config path when launching the wizard without an existing config, and also probe XDG locations so legacy `~/.config/pvetui` setups are discovered. (#69, #70)

## [1.0.15] - 2025-12-21

### Added

- **Backup Management**: Comprehensive backup functionality for VMs and containers with visual task indicators and auto-refresh capabilities.
- **Backup Performance**: Optimized backup retrieval with caching and parallel storage scanning for faster loading.
- **Backup UX**: Added visual indicators for running backup tasks and auto-refresh when operations complete.
- **Backup Navigation**: Added 'Refresh' action (Ctrl+R) to Backup Manager for manual updates.
- **Command Runner Descriptions**: Display user-friendly descriptions for all commands to help users understand purpose before execution.
- **Default Startup Group**: `default_profile` can now be set to an aggregate group name so pvetui starts directly in the combined group view.

### Fixed

- **Backup Storage Listing**: Fixed backup creation form and list by implementing proper `GetNodeStorages` API endpoint for accurate storage retrieval.
- **Backup Keyboard Handling**: Whitelisted backup pages in keyboard handler to prevent global hotkey conflicts with form input.
- **SOPS Group Management**: Prevent unwanted re-encryption of already-encrypted configs during group operations.
- **Profile Template Cleanup**: Removed obsolete "work" profile from default configuration template to prevent confusion.
- **Wizard Back-Tab Navigation**: Restored Shift+Tab (back-tab) focus navigation in the Profile Editor and Config Wizard, including button rows.
- **UI Deadlocks**: Fixed deadlock issues in "Add Group" dialog and other UI components.
- **Focus Management**: Resolved focus loss in "Add Group" workflow and other form interactions.
- **Profile/Group Name Conflicts**: Startup validation now directs users to repair existing configs instead of offering to overwrite them, and UI entry points block creating groups or profiles with conflicting names.
- **Config Repair Targeting**: When a profile/group name conflict is detected on startup, the editor now opens the conflicting profile so it can be renamed.
- **Onboarding Messaging**: Startup guidance now distinguishes first-run setup from fixing an existing configuration.
- **Footer Key Hints**: Global menu and context menu shortcuts are now listed separately, with Esc shown for the global menu.
- **Key Normalization**: Ctrl+Shift+Tab normalization now preserves the Ctrl modifier across tcell versions.

### Changed

- **Task Polling Architecture**: Decoupled task polling from App component for better separation of concerns.

## [1.0.14] - 2025-12-07

### Added

- **Aggregate Cluster Support**: Introduced the ability to define and manage multiple Proxmox VE clusters as a single, aggregated view. Users can now:
  - Configure aggregate groups within `config.yml` to combine multiple Proxmox profiles.
  - Switch between individual profiles and aggregate groups via the profile picker in the UI.
  - Launch the application directly into an aggregate group using the `--profile="group-name"` CLI flag.
  - View aggregated CPU, memory, storage, and task information across all connected clusters.
  - Perform VM operations (start, stop, migration, etc.) on individual VMs within the aggregate view, with operations correctly routed to the respective source cluster.
  - Utilize VNC and SSH shell access for VMs and nodes across aggregated clusters.

- **API spec generation**: New `gen-openapi` Make target and `pve-openapi-gen` tool generate an OpenAPI 3 spec from `docs/local/apidoc.js`, making Proxmox endpoints easier to consume and keep in sync.

### Fixed

- **About dialog metadata**: Widened the About modal so GitHub links no longer wrap/break and backfilled commit/build date when ldflags aren't provided (e.g., `go install`).
- **Plugin manager modal**: Expanded the manage-plugins dialog further (wider center column) so long plugin descriptions stay visible.
- **LXC shell via root SSH**: Skip `sudo` when the profile `ssh_user` is `root`, preventing failures on Proxmox hosts without sudo and eliminating unnecessary elevation.
- **Community scripts navigation**: Restored visible selection highlighting in the script/category lists.
- **Community scripts install**: Show script page link and explicit curl/bash command; installations no longer require sudo when connecting as root (fall back to `su`).
- **Command runner SSH target**: Use node IPs instead of hostnames for SSH, reducing DNS reliance.
- **SSH debug visibility**: Added debug logs for all SSH invocations (node/VM shells, command runner, community scripts) including user/host/command, and centralized logging to the single cache log file.
- **IP address debugging (issue #56)**: Added comprehensive debug logging at cluster parsing, node lookup, and shell invocation stages to track IP addresses through the entire flow. Logs include string length, byte representation, and raw JSON values to help diagnose potential IP corruption issues.
- **Hotkey override hook**: UI components can now register a hotkey override instead of being added to the growing modal whitelist, reducing global shortcut conflicts.
- **Profile add cancel**: Cancelling “Add New Profile” no longer leaves a phantom `new_profile` entry in the manager list.
- **Community scripts fetch**: Script metadata now fetched concurrently (worker pool) to speed up inventory loading while respecting caching.

## [1.0.13] - 2025-11-29

### Added

- **Enhanced Guest Search**: Guest search now includes IP addresses and tags in addition to name, ID, type, status, and node name for more comprehensive filtering

### Fixed

- **noVNC Assets with go install**: Fixed missing noVNC vendor files (pako compression library) when installing via `go install` by renaming `vendor/` to `lib/` (Go's embed package excludes directories named 'vendor' by design). The `prune_novnc.sh` script now automatically handles this transformation after updating the noVNC subtree from upstream.
- **Release packaging**: Updated noVNC pako license paths in GoReleaser, RPM/DEB, and Docker release artifacts after moving `vendor/pako` to `lib/pako`, restoring successful binary publishing.
- **Selection Visibility on Windows**: Added reverse video attribute to selected items for better visibility on Windows Terminal with black backgrounds (Vintage, Campbell, IBM 5153 color schemes). Selected nodes/VMs now use inverted colors that work regardless of theme or terminal settings.

## [1.0.12] - 2025-11-24

### Added

- **Command Runner Plugin**: Standardized the Linux host/container/guest command sets and added richer troubleshooting helpers (process sorters, `ip route/link show`, resolver dumps, etc.) plus expanded Windows networking/DNS commands so you can capture CPU, memory, and connectivity data from the same menu.
- **VM SSH User Override**: New `vm_ssh_user` config/flag/env option lets you specify a different SSH username for QEMU VM shells while keeping `ssh_user` for node/LXC access (falls back automatically when omitted).

### Changed

- **Command Runner Plugin**: After closing the command output modal you now land back in the command list, making it much faster to run multiple commands back-to-back.

### Fixed

- **VM Migration Polling**: Fixed migration operations to properly wait for Proxmox task completion via UPID before attempting to poll the target node, eliminating "Configuration file does not exist" errors during active migrations
- **Task Completion Detection**: Improved task completion detection to use the `EndTime` field instead of status string matching, ensuring all task failures (including "migration problems" and other non-standard error messages) are properly caught
- **Post-Operation Refresh Blocking**: Fixed "Cannot refresh data while there are pending operations in progress" message appearing after successful VM operations by clearing pending state immediately after operation completion for all VM lifecycle actions (start, stop, shutdown, restart, reset, delete, and migrate)

## [1.0.11] - 2025-11-20

### Changed

- Guest Insights plugin now uses the full main panel dimensions so its table matches other plugin experiences.
- Tasks page table now expands to the full page width so its columns no longer appear cramped on larger terminals.

### Fixed

- Startup auto-encryption now runs only when plain-text secrets are actually detected, eliminating the repeating “Encrypted sensitive fields” banner and unnecessary config rewrites.
- Non-SOPS config saves no longer duplicate the active connection at the bottom of `config.yml`; sensitive-field encryption now keeps values inside their profile only.

## [1.0.10] - 2025-11-14

### Added

- Plaintext `password`/`token_secret` values in non-SOPS configs are now auto-encrypted on startup, so sensitive fields never linger in cleartext on disk once you've successfully connected.

### Changed

- Replaced the demo-oriented guest list plugin with a "Guest Insights" experience featuring a sortable/filterable table, jump-to-guest navigation, and on-demand metric refreshes so node actions are actually useful during day-to-day ops.
- Cluster status view now recognizes single-node installs, showing a sane 1/1 node count and a "Quorate: N/A" message instead of a scary "No" status.

## [1.0.9] - 2025-11-12

### Added

- **Command Runner Plugin - QEMU VM Support**: Execute whitelisted commands on QEMU VMs via guest agent
  - Commands execute via `/nodes/{node}/qemu/{vmid}/agent/exec` and `/agent/exec-status` endpoints
  - Support for templated commands with parameters (e.g., `systemctl status {service}`)
  - 'C' keyboard shortcut on VMs with guest agent enabled and running
  - Expanded VM command whitelist: `uptime`, `df -h`, `free -h`, `systemctl status`, `journalctl`, `ps aux`, `ip addr show`
  - Polling logic to wait for command completion with proper timeout handling
  - API client adapter to bridge plugin VM struct with full API client types
  - Commands wrapped in `["/bin/sh", "-c", "command"]` for shell feature support

- **Command Runner Plugin - OS-Aware VM Commands**: Detect QEMU guest operating systems and show Linux shell or Windows PowerShell command lists automatically.

- **Command Runner Plugin - Expanded Linux/LXC Utilities**: Added `journalctl -n 50`, `systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running`, `systemctl list-unit-files --state=enabled`, `who`, and `last -n 20` to the default Linux VM and LXC whitelists for faster troubleshooting.

### Fixed

- **Guest Agent Response Parsing**: Fixed critical bug where Proxmox returns `exited` field as integer (0/1) but code attempted to parse as boolean, causing infinite polling loop and "Invalid parameter 'pid'" errors on second poll
- **Version Detection**: `go install` builds now report the correct semantic version by using `debug.ReadBuildInfo()` to extract module metadata instead of hard-coding "vdev".

## [1.0.8] - 2025-11-04

### Changed

- Switched noVNC integration from a git submodule to a git subtree rooted at internal/vnc/novnc, ensuring full compatibility with `go install` and other Go tooling.
- All noVNC assets are now tracked directly in the repository. The update process is now documented in the README, and updating to new versions uses `git subtree pull`.

## [1.0.7] - 2025-10-21

### Added

- Pluggable feature architecture for UI contributions with runtime registration and lifecycle management.
- Community Scripts functionality extracted into the `community-scripts` plugin; enable it via the `plugins.enabled` setting.
- Demo "guest list" plugin that adds a node action presenting running guests in a modal.
- LRU (Least Recently Used) cache eviction with configurable size limits to prevent unbounded memory growth.
- Configurable API retry count via `DefaultRetryCount` constant for easier tuning.
- Manage Plugins dialog in the global menu to toggle plugins, persist configuration changes, and flag the required restart.

### Changed

- Plugins are now disabled by default; update configuration to opt into optional features such as community scripts.
- Configuration files now honour the `plugins.enabled` list instead of falling back to legacy defaults.
- Cache implementation now uses `json.RawMessage` to eliminate double JSON marshaling/unmarshaling overhead.
- FileCache now implements LRU eviction with doubly-linked list for efficient cache management.
- Manage Plugins dialog list now supports Vim-style `j`/`k` navigation keys for faster keyboard control.

### Fixed

- Allow post-operation refreshes to run by clearing VM pending state before triggering automatic data reloads after lifecycle actions.
- Removed potential password exposure from authentication debug logs.
- Fixed race condition in `AuthManager.GetValidToken()` method with improved locking pattern.
- Added HTTP request timeouts to all API methods (30-second default) to prevent indefinite hangs.
- BadgerDB goroutine leak fixed with proper cleanup channel for background garbage collection.
- Badger cache close routine is now idempotent to avoid `close of closed channel` panics during integration tests.
- Lock file handling vulnerability fixed with proper PID validation to prevent cache corruption.
- File permissions in test files changed from 0o644 to 0o600 for better security.

## [1.0.6] - 2025-09-13

### Added

- **VM Action Protection System**: Comprehensive protection mechanism to prevent VM actions while operations are pending
  - **Context Menu Protection**: Lifecycle actions (start, stop, restart, delete, migrate) are hidden when VMs have pending operations
  - **Keyboard Shortcut Protection**: Shell, VNC, and context menu shortcuts are blocked for VMs with pending operations
  - **Visual Indicators**: Pending VMs show dimmed status with special indicators
  - **Menu Title Updates**: Context menu titles show current pending operation status (e.g., "Guest Actions (Starting)")
  - **Snapshot Protection**: Create, delete, and rollback snapshot operations are blocked while VMs have pending operations
  - **Configuration Protection**: VM config editing and storage resizing are blocked during pending operations
  - **Migration Protection**: Migration dialog is blocked for VMs with pending operations

  - **Auto-Refresh Protection**: Auto-refresh cannot be enabled while there are pending operations
  - **Helper Functions**: Added `CanVMPerformActions()` and `GetVMPendingOperation()` for easier pending state checking
  - **Thread-Safe Operations**: All pending state operations use proper mutex protection for concurrent access

### Fixed

- **VM Pending State Timing**: Fixed visual glitch where deleted VMs would briefly return to "normal" state before being removed
  - **Delete Operations**: VMs now stay in pending state until refresh completes and they're removed from the UI
  - **Migration Operations**: VMs stay in pending state until refresh shows them in their new location
  - **Consistent Behavior**: All operations now maintain pending state until refresh operations complete
  - **Better User Experience**: Users can see VMs remain in pending state until operations truly complete

## [1.0.5] - 2025-08-24

### MAJOR BREAKING CHANGE

- **Project Renamed to pvetui**
  - Rename was necessary in order to remain compliant with Proxmox trademark
  - Old paths referencing `proxmox-tui` must be renamed to `pvetui`. For example:

    ```
    mv ~/.config/proxmox-tui ~/.config/pvetui
    ```

  - **Additional migration steps:**
    - Update any shell aliases or scripts referencing the old binary name
    - Update any systemd service files or cron jobs
    - Update any documentation or bookmarks referencing the old project name
    - **Environment Variables:** Change prefix from `PROXMOX_` to `PVETUI_` (e.g., `PROXMOX_HOST` → `PVETUI_HOST`)
  - **Impact:** This change affects configuration paths, binary names, environment variables, and all project references

### Added

- **Multi-platform Package Distribution**: Added comprehensive support for distributing pvetui through multiple package managers
- **32-bit builds**: Add official 32-bit binaries by request in [#25](https://github.com/devnullvoid/pvetui/issues/25)
  - Linux: `linux/386`
  - Windows: `windows/386`
  - Included in GoReleaser config and local Makefile release target

  - **AUR Support**: Complete Arch User Repository integration with automated PKGBUILD generation and management
  - **Homebrew Tap**: macOS and Linux distribution via Homebrew with automated formula updates
  - **Scoop Bucket**: Windows distribution via Scoop with automated manifest management
  - **DEB/RPM Packages**: Traditional Linux package formats automatically generated by GoReleaser
  - **Docker Images**: Multi-platform container images published to GitHub Container Registry
  - **Orchestration Scripts**: Unified management of all package managers through a single command interface
  - **Automated Updates**: Scripts to automatically update package definitions with new versions and checksums
  - **Local Testing**: Built-in testing and validation for all package formats before publishing
  - **Makefile Integration**: New targets for package manager operations (setup, update, status, clean)
  - **Comprehensive Documentation**: Complete guide covering setup, maintenance, and troubleshooting for all platforms

### Documentation

- **README Updates**: Fixed CLI argument conventions and improved documentation
  - Updated all CLI examples to use correct double-dash format (`--config` instead of `-config`)
  - Added comprehensive CLI reference table with all available flags and short versions
  - Fixed broken anchor links in navigation for better user experience
  - Replaced problematic emojis with compatible ones for consistent anchor generation
  - Updated project title to 'TUI for Proxmox Virtual Environment' for trademark compliance

  - Enhanced demo section with both GIF (GitHub compatible) and WebM (high quality) options
  - Fixed CLI examples throughout all documentation files for consistency

## [1.0.4] - 2025-08-19

### Added

- **Guest name editing**: Added ability to change QEMU VM names and LXC container hostnames from the config page
  - QEMU VMs: Edit the "name" field which updates the VM display name
  - LXC containers: Edit the "hostname" field which updates the container hostname
  - Real-time title updates show the new name as you type
  - Changes are saved to Proxmox and reflected immediately in the UI
  - Input validation prevents invalid hostname characters (underscores, spaces, special chars)
  - Validates hostname format (no leading/trailing hyphens, proper length limits)
  - Fixed UI refresh issue with professional polling approach that verifies API changes before refreshing
  - Added loading indicators during API propagation delay for better user experience
  - Enhanced header component with ShowWarning method for better user feedback
  - Refactored polling functionality into dedicated function for improved maintainability
  - Fixed race condition by polling both config and cluster resources endpoints to ensure complete propagation
- **Cross-platform config and cache paths**: Added native support for Windows config/cache directories
  - Windows: Config in `%APPDATA%/pvetui`, Cache in `%LOCALAPPDATA%/pvetui`
  - macOS: Uses XDG-style paths (`~/.config/pvetui`, `~/.cache/pvetui`) for consistency with other TUI applications
  - Linux: Maintains existing XDG support (`~/.config/pvetui`, `~/.cache/pvetui`)
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing XDG functions
  - Environment variables still override platform defaults when set

### Breaking Changes

- **Windows users only**: Existing config files in XDG-style paths need to be moved to new platform-specific locations
  - **Windows**: Move from `~/.config/pvetui/` to `%APPDATA%/pvetui/`
  - **macOS/Linux**: No changes required - existing paths continue to work
  - The application will automatically use the new paths on first run after this update

### Fixed

- Community Scripts: returning from installation no longer blanks the screen. The selector now closes before refresh and a brief post-resume delay ensures stable UI restore.
- Data Refresh: new containers/VMs created by community scripts are shown immediately without restarting. After install we trigger a hard refresh (cache cleared) and the manual refresh rebuilds the guest list from fresh cluster data.
- Header: eliminated brief spinner flash that could reappear after success/error messages.
- Manual Refresh stability: VM list now rebuilt strictly from cluster resources; filtering preserved across consecutive refreshes; removed VM details flicker and selection jump by stabilizing selection and suppressing programmatic callbacks during list rebuild.
- VM delete selection fallback: after deleting a VM, selection now moves to the first remaining VM and the details panel updates accordingly; clears details when the list becomes empty.
- Manual Refresh optimization: refactored complex refresh logic into separate functions for better maintainability; reduced UI update calls and improved incremental node enrichment; fixed regression where VM list would become empty after refresh due to enriched nodes not preserving VM data from original cluster resources.

## [1.0.3] - 2025-08-09

### Added

- **Guest power actions:** Added Shutdown (graceful), Stop (force), and Reset (hard, QEMU-only) alongside Restart/Start in the guest context menu, with clear confirmations and shortcuts.

### Fixed

  - Ensure config directory creation uses OS-agnostic path handling when saving from the config/profile wizards and menu actions.
  - Fixes saving when adding/editing profiles and when setting default profile on Windows.
- **Windows: Locally built binaries sometimes failed to start**
  - Align local Windows builds with release artifacts by disabling CGO and using baseline CPU target.
  - Scoped compatibility flags to Windows/amd64 only to avoid affecting other platforms.
- **UI: Reduce noisy page removal errors in logs**
  - Remove pages only when present to avoid benign "Failed to remove … page" errors.

## [1.0.2] - 2025-08-07

### Fixed

- **Profile Switching: Separate Active vs Default profile**
  - Introduced a non-persisted runtime `ActiveProfile` distinct from the persisted `default_profile` in config.
  - Switching profiles in the UI now updates only the active profile; the default indicator and config file are not overwritten.
